USB Armada3700 OTG PHY

This controller is integrated only in Armada-3700.

Armada-3700 could be working in USB OTG mode which supports USB Host/Device mode
switching dynamically. To do that, the following dts changes are required:
- Enable both USB Host (usb3) and Device (u3d and udc) controller DT nodes.
- Enable OTG PHY TD node and make sure XHCI DT node have reference to it with
  "usb-phy" property.
Armada-3700 could also be working in USB static host mode, when USB Device feature
is not required.

Required properties:
- compatible	: should be "marvell,armada-3700-usb-phy"
- reg		: Physical base address and size of the USB3 device registers map.
- interrupts	: Should contain single irq line of USB3 device controller

Optional properties:
- vcc-supply: phandle to the regulator that provides power to the PHY.
- marvell,static-host-mode: OTG PHY is working in usb static host mode, with no host/device
  switching supported.

USB OTG mode example:
	usb_phy: usb_phy@5d800 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-usb-phy";
		reg = <0x5d800 0x100>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 16 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		vcc-supply = <&exp_usb3_vbus>;
		status = "okay";
	};

USB Static Host mode example:
	usb_phy: usb_phy@5d800 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-usb-phy";
		reg = <0x5d800 0x100>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 16 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		marvell,static-host-mode;
		vcc-supply = <&exp_usb3_vbus>;
		status = "okay";
	};
