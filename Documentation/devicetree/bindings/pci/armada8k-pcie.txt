Armada-8K PCIe DT details:
==========================

Armada-8k uses synopsis designware PCIe controller.

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "marvell,armada8k-pcie", "snps,dw-pcie".
- reg: base addresses and lengths of the pcie control and global control registers.
 "ctrl" registers points to the global control registers, while the "config" space
 points to the pcie configuration registers as mentioned in dw-pcie dt bindings in the link below.
- interrupt-map-mask and interrupt-map, standard PCI properties to
  define the mapping of the PCIe interface to interrupt numbers.
- All other definitions as per generic PCI bindings
See "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/designware-pcie.txt"

Optional properties:
PHY support is supported for armada-8k, and the following parameters are used:
- phys		    : phandle to phy node associated with pcie controller.
- phy-names	    : must be "pcie-phyX", such as pcie-phy0, pcie-phy1, etc. The X means the pcie
                      lane index from perspective of PCIe controller although the physical phy is comphy
                      serdes lane5 or other comphy lane. In this way, driver implementation will support
                      PCIe case with width more than 1, such as X2, X4.
- reset-gpios	    : a pointer to the PCI device reset via gpio. This entry is mandatory of A8040 MCBin.


Example of PCIE RC X1:

	compatible = "marvell,armada8k-pcie", "snps,dw-pcie";
	reg = <0 0x608000 0 0x1000>, <0 0x00600000 0 0x01000>;
