* Clock bindings for Marvell MVEBU Armada 3700 CPU PM clock

The Marvell MVEBU Armada 3700 SoC contains a PMU block, used for power
management, and DFS is supported by this PMU.
This Device Tree binding allows to describe the DFS clock settings
and CPU mapping of the Armada 3700, whose frequencies are determined by
the CPU load index with PMU DFS unit.

NOTE:
When cpu_pm_clock node is enabled, and CPU clock driver initialized
successfully, it will also register and enable the cpufreq-dt generic
driver for CPU frequency scaling.


Required properties for cpu_pm_clock node:
- compatible: must be be the following:
	"marvell,armada-37xx-cpu-pm-clk"
- reg: must be the register address of the CPU Dynamic Frequency Base
	Scaling register base
- #clock-cells: from common clock binding; shall be set to 1
- #clock: pointer to CPU core clock

Required properties for CPU nodes:
- clocks: a list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs to cpu_pm_clk,
		one for each CPU node.

Example:
	cpu0: cpu@000 {
		..
		clocks = <&cpu_pm_clk 0>;
		..
	};
	cpu1: cpu@001 {
		..
		clocks = <&cpu_pm_clk 0>;
		..
	};

	cpu_pm_clk: cpu-pm-clk@14018 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-37xx-cpu-pm-clk";
		reg = <0x14018 0x1C>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		clocks = <&core_clk 4>;
	};
